# Online networking games for STK

## Hosting server
First of all, you can compile STK with `-DSERVER_ONLY=ON` which will produce a GUI-less STK binary optimized for size and memory usage, useful for situation like in VPS.

### Hosting WAN (public internet) server
You are required to have an stk online account first, go [here](https://addons.supertuxkart.net/register.php) for registration.

It is recommended you have a saved user in your computer to allow hosting multiple servers simultaneously with the same account, if you have a fresh STK installation, first run:

`supertuxkart --init-user --login=your_registered_name --password=your_password`

After that you should see `Done saving user, leaving` in terminal if it successfully logged in.

Than you can just run:

`supertuxkart --server-config=your_config.xml --network-console`

It will create that xml configuration file if not found in current directory, you can type `quit` in terminal, than you can edit that file for further configuration as required.

The current server configuration xml looks like this:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<server-config version="4" >

    <!-- Name of server, encode in XML if you want to use unicode characters. -->
    <server-name value="stk server" />

    <!-- Port used in server, if you specify 0, it will use the server port specified in stk_config.xml or if random-server-port is enabled in user config, than any port. STK will auto change to random port if the port you specify failed to be bound. -->
    <server-port value="0" />

    <!-- Game mode in server, 0 is normal race (grand prix), 1 is time trial (grand prix), 3 is normal race, 4 time trial, 6 is soccer, 7 is free-for-all and 8 is capture the flag. Notice: grand prix server doesn't allow for players to join and wait for ongoing game. -->

    <!-- Clients below this value will be rejected from joining this server. It's determined by number of official tracks in client / number of official tracks in server, setting this value too high will prevent android players from joining this server, because STK android apk has some official tracks removed. -->

    <!-- If true, the server owner can config the difficulty and game mode in the GUI of lobby.

```

At the moment STK has a list of STUN servers for NAT penetration which allows players or servers behind a firewall or router to be able to connect to each other, but in case it doesn't work, you have to manually disable the firewall or port forward the port(s) used by the STK.
By default STK servers use port `2759`. For example, in Ubuntu based distributions, run the following command to disable the firewall on that port:

`sudo ufw allow 2759`

You may also need to handle the server discovery port `2757` for connecting your WAN server in LAN / localhost.

Notice: You don't need to make any firewall or router configuration changes if you connect to our official servers.

### Hosting LAN (local internet) server
Everything is basically the same as WAN one, except you don't need an stk online account, just do:

`supertuxkart --server-config=your_config.xml --lan-server=your_server_name --network-console`

In LAN network it is required that the server and server discovery port is connectable by clients directly, no NAT penetration will be done in LAN.

------
After the first time configuration, you can just start the server with the command:

`supertuxkart --server-config=your_config.xml`, regardless of whether LAN or WAN server is chosen (of course you need to have a saved user for the WAN one), by default your server logging will be saved to the STK configuration directory with a name of `your_config.log`, given that the server configuration filename is `your_config.xml`.

You can find out that directory location [here (See Where is the configuration stored?)](https://supertuxkart.net/FAQ)

## Testing server
There is a network AI tester in STK which can use AI on player controller for server hosting linear races game mode, which helps automating the testing for servers, to enable it use:

`supertuxkart --connect-now=x.x.x.x:y --server-id=id --network-ai=n --auto-connect --no-graphics`

x.x.x.x:y is your server ip address with its port, id is the id field of server-info in STK server xml list, omit it if you are testing LAN server, n is the number of AI you want to create.

You can see STK server xml list [here](https://addons.supertuxkart.net/api/v2/server/get-all).

You can remove `--auto-connect` if you have another client which can control the starting of games in server, or you can consider enable owner-less mode on server so the games on server can keep going. Remove `--no-graphics` if you want to see the AI racing. You can also run network AI tester in server-only build of STK.

With the network AI tester, it's easier to for example simulate high-loaded servers or bad (high ping with packet loss) network.

Tested on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, if you have 8 players connected to a server hosted on it, the usage of a single CPU core is ~60% and there are ~60MB of memory usage for game with heavy tracks like Cocoa Temple or Candela City on the server, you can use the above figures to consider number of STK servers hosting on a same computer.

For bad network simulation, we recommend `network traffic control` by linux kernel, see [here](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/networking/netem) for details.

You have the best gaming experience when choosing server having all players less than 100ms ping with no packet loss.
